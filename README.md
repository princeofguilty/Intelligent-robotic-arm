### A very intelligent robotic arm, Object detection model detects robotic arm and target object then does inverse kinamatics calculations to accuratly pick up target object 

### we are not the creators of yolov7, its a clone from [YOLOV7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) with some modifications and a bug fix from at the time we cloned yolov7

### [Dataset we created and used for training](https://universe.roboflow.com/teamproject-3f4si/robotic-arm-akk9a)

### [Trained Model](https://www.mediafire.com/file/hkx13g12va5kshb/best_o2.pt/file)

## Instructions
- start "detector_custom.py" and run the matlab code "RoboticsProject.m"
- we used ip webcam, replace in detector_custom if needed
- replace arduino com6 in "RoboticsProject.m" with yours
- replace all 'IP's with yours
